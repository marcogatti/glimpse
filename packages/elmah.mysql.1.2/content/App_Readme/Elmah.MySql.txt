Please note that in order to complete the installation of ELMAH.MySql you will have to do the following:

1) Make sure you have the latest MySQL Connector installed from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/ (this is optional, since we already include MySql.Data.dll, if you download the latest connector you don't need our version)
2) Run the Elmah.MySql.sql script against your database
3) Edit your web.config with the correct settings in the elmah <connectionString> to connect to your database
